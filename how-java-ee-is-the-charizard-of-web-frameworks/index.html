        <p>When using Java EE to create web applications Java EE can be a
powerful but difficult to use platform. I list in this post some of
the more frustrating things I have encountered recently while using
Java EE. These frustrations aside, I found creating applications with
Java EE to be efficient and without major pains especially for large
projects where the initial overhead of the complex platform stops
becoming a hindrance and starts simplifying difficult problems. 
</p>

<h2>Frustrating aspects of Java EE</h2>
<p>There are 6 ways I list here in which I have had difficulty with
Java EE. Firstly, I would like to correct my own post title, as <em>it
is not entirely correct to call Java EE a web development framework</em>.
It is so much more than that. However, this brings us nicely to the
first frustrating aspect of Java EE which bewilders newcomers: what
exactly is Java EE? 
</p>
<h3>1. What exactly is Java EE</h3>
<p>When I visited Wikipedia, I found this description of Java EE: 
</p>
<blockquote>Java Platform, Enterprise Edition or Java EE is Oracle&#8217;s
<em>enterprise</em> Java <em>computing platform</em>. The platform
provides an API and <em>runtime environment</em> for developing and
running <em>enterprise software</em>, including network and web
services, and other large-scale, <em>multi-tiered</em>, scalable,
reliable, and secure network applications. Java EE extends the Java
Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE), providing an API for
<em>object-relational mapping</em>, <em>distributed</em> and
<em>multi-tier architectures</em>, and web services. The platform
incorporates a design based largely on <em>modular components</em>
running on an <em>application server</em>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This explanation of Java EE seems like a definition which you
might re-read after mastering a topic and chuckle to yourself as you
recognize and appreciate each buzz-word. While each buzz-word may be
simple to understand on its own, listing so many buzz-words together
doesn&#8217;t paint a clear picture of Java EE. While a newcomer to Java
EE, I found it very difficult to penetrate past the dense layer of
jargon words which were ubiquitous. And it seems <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15774924/just-what-is-java-ee-really?lq=1">I
wasn’t alone</a>. 
</p>
<h3>2. 100 ways to do the same thing</h3>
<p>With flexibility comes choice. When I began using Java EE, I
struggled to decide how to tackle problems, even simple problems.
When I am solving a problem, I feel comfortable creating a solution
which I feel takes into account best practices and the success of
other approaches to similar problems. However, I would find myself
spending 90% of my time researching architectural decisions before
beginning to tackle a task. This was due to the <em>overwhelming
choice provided by the Java EE landscape</em>. Here are some of the
sources of choice: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>There are many implementations of
	Java EE (this choice can be broken down as each layer of the Java EE
	stack such as <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Persistence">JPA</a>
	and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_API_for_RESTful_Web_Services">JX-RS</a>
	can have multiple implementations). 
	</p>
	<li><p>There are many application servers
	(such as <a href="https://glassfish.java.net/">Glassfish</a>, <a href="http://www.wildfly.org/">JBoss
	AS/WildFly</a>, <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/websphere/">WebSphere</a>,
	Tomcat/<a href="http://tomee.apache.org/apache-tomee.html">TomEE</a>,
	<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/middleware/weblogic/overview/index.html">WebLogic</a>)
		</p>
	<li><p>Which layer of the stack to use:
	should I put the logic in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaServer_Faces">JSF</a>’s
	managed beans, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejb">EJB</a>s,
	or plain Java classes (or sometimes even in JSF/JSP files). 
	</p>
	<li><p>Which mentality should I have: as
	each Java EE version is released, new approaches to old problems are
	invented and become available alongside the old ones in a quiver of
	choices. The new approaches hold promises of increased productivity
	while the old approaches have reliable documentation, are not as
	affected by bugs and work alongside my existing code. It reality, a
	mix and match of new and old get used together. 
	</p>
	<li><p>Packaging options: should I have WARs and EJB JARs in an EAR,
	or just use a lightweight WAR? 
	</p>
</ul>
<p>Java EE offers immense flexibility, and if you don&#8217;t need this
flexibility you will probably waste time having to deal with it. 
</p>
<h3>3. Development is slowed by deployment</h3>
<p>Unlike frameworks like the Java/Scala <a href="http://www.playframework.com/">Play
Framework</a> or <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>,
Java EE requires compilation and deployment before changes can be
observed live. The largest application I worked on comprised of a
number of  modular projects with many separate JARs, WARs and EARs.
<em>Testing a few changes would require waiting about 20-30 seconds
before seeing them live</em> (using at the time powerful hardware).
This delay was torturous when testing minor tweaks. There are some
tools to lessen this issue; <a href="http://zeroturnaround.com/software/jrebel/">JRebel</a>
allows for instantaneous changes, if you can afford it; and Netbeans
has some <a href="http://wiki.netbeans.org/CompileOnSave#Java_EE">features
for live deployment</a>, but it doesn&#8217;t solve the whole problem and
you then must give up any choice of IDE if you want the problem
solved. 
</p>
<h3>4. PermGen error</h3>
<p>While not a universal problem, this memory error can be very
annoying while developing and testing. When an application is
redeployed multiple times,  the application server I used, Glassfish,
would steadily increase its memory usage. This is due to the
classloaders of the previous deployments and their loaded classes <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7683434/permgen-space-error-glassfish-server">not
being garbage collected fully</a>. The memory leak would result in
Glassfish having a PermGen Error ever 6-8 redeploys, and would
require a forced killing and restart. While this issue was annoying,
it did become office humor when someone would get<em> </em><em>&#8216;</em><em>PermGenned</em><em>&#8217;</em>.
</p>
<h3>5. Cryptic stack traces</h3>
<p>It often looks like Glassfish uses my application’s exception
trace as a channel to carry out a lengthy  conversation with some
entity called Grizzy or Felix. Somewhere, often not obvious, the
reason for the exception might be buried. The error messages received
are often very vague and can cover a broad range of possible root
causes. 
</p>
<h3>6. JSF abstracts away important technologies</h3>
<p>JSF is great for developers to quickly create nicely looking
prototype web applications without having to: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Worry about the details of
	creating a stateful application on-top of HTTP. 
	</p>
	<li><p>Worry about CSS (instead use a component library, such as
	<a href="http://thoughtworks.fileburst.com/assets/technology-radar-jan-2014-en.pdf">Primefaces</a>).
		</p>
</ul>
<p>However, JSF does this by abstracting away CSS, HTML  and many
HTTP characteristics. The abstraction is not easy to work with and
obstructs the power of the front end web technologies. This
abstraction makes it  difficult to work alongside designers and front
end developers who are not familiar with JSF. A <a href="http://thoughtworks.fileburst.com/assets/technology-radar-jan-2014-en.pdf">ThoughtWork&#8217;s
report</a> highlights some of the issues with JSF and suggests avoid
it.</p>
<h2>The potential power of Java EE</h2>
<p>Java EE embodies a powerful set of technologies but is difficult
to use. Java EE abstracts away a phenomenal amount of complexity and
creates a structure to encourage flexibility and extensibility. It
may be beneficial to use Java EE if a project is expected to be
complex and flexibility is needed. In other cases, using a simpler
framework such as the Java/Scala Play Framework, will probably be
more efficient.</p>
