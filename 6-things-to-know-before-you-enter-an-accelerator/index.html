        <p>I took part in New Zealand’s startup accelerator, Lighting
Lab, an accelerator modelled on Techstars. Here are six things I learnt.  I
tried to cover topics which are not frequently covered elsewhere.  </p>

<!-- more -->

<h2>Beware of people who state their opinion as fact</h2>

<p>Our team interacted with 30-40 mentors though the program.
The help and advice was invaluable in guiding our business and broadening our perspective.
However, it is difficult to unify or distil many opinions or suggestions when
so many contradict. When considering someone’s advice, one rule which helped us
was to be wary of anyone who stated their opinion as fact. People who convey
their opinion as absolute often do not consider multiple perspectives, or they may
be applying logic which worked for them without acknowledging the unique
factors and risks associated with your situation. </p>

<h2>It is not usually a quick journey</h2>

<p>There are many stories in the media of businesses which
skyrocket to success. During the accelerator program, I was exposed to the
stories of such a large number businesses that my perception of the typical
startup journey changed significantly. I now know that the large majority of
startups are not overnight successes. Instead, I expect a startup to take-up
5-7 years of my life before I will see a return. This revelation can cause a
massive shift in an entrepreneur’s perspective. A runner who enjoys sprints may
suddenly find himself in a marathon. While this shift in perspective has not
caused my entrepreneurial spirit to waver, it has caused me to re-evaluate
other aspects of my life and has changed how I will approach the next few years
ahead. </p>

<h2>It is not often clear when to end a business</h2>

<p>Some startups may experience an event which makes it clear
that it is time to end the startup and move on to another idea. This is not the
norm. From my experience, teams regularly make half-blind estimates of whether
their business is still going to be successful. The decision is muddled by the
team’s current enthusiasm for the startup and the attractiveness of what they
could otherwise be doing with their lives. </p>

<p>A startup will have ups and downs as it experiences breakthroughs
and setbacks. It is difficult to know whether a down period is the beginning of
the end, or just a lull before an upward trend. Team members often ponder the
future of the business during the down times, sometimes just to themselves. When
analysing the health of the business, make sure to separate the business’s ups
and downs from the ups and downs of the team – when the team is tired and worn
out, it is easy to have an overly pessimistic view of the business, and conversely
there can be an overly positive view when the team is buzzing with excitement. Be
prepared to often analyse the health of the business and do not wait for a
clear signal before moving on to another idea. Conversely, don’t jump ship when
the team is worn down; take a rest and re-evaluate later.</p>

<h2>The importance of a big idea</h2>

<p>At first, I was annoyed with advisors and investors who
would frown on our initial business; it had a reasonably small market size and
wasn’t going to be a 100 million dollar business. It was not going to be big,
but it had a high chance of being <em>something</em>. As a 23 year old just out
of university, I would much prefer to have a 50% chance of 2 million rather
than 10% chance of 200 million. Why would people scoff at a ‘lifestyle business’
when a good lifestyle is most people’s dream?</p>

<p>I have come to see the importance of a big idea. A small business
is not a lesser business, it is just not a very investable business. Some <a
href="http://fundersandfounders.com/how-funding-works-splitting-equity/">simple
math can uncover the reasoning.</a> If a business begins with two or three
founders, receives two rounds of funding and allocates shares for early
employees, very quickly each founder may find themselves with ~15% equity. If
the founders spend 5 years working on the business and it exits for $2 million,
300K suddenly does not seem like a huge reward for five years of hard work with
a high risk of failure. Investors would get a similarly small return; hence,
they rarely invest in businesses with small potential even if they are likely
to succeed. If you are lucky enough to be able to bootstrap a lifestyle
business, ignore the disdain. However, if your business is going to need
investment, it needs to have big dreams. </p>

<h2>A balanced lifestyle beats long hours</h2>

<p>There is a common opinion that accelerators are typically 3
months long as 3 months is the right amount of time to validate, build and present
a business. I think 3 months is
suspiciously close to the maximum length of time the average entrepreneur
can work at full throttle before burning out. Like many others, I worked intensely
with long hours throughout the program. The business became the focus of my
day, every day. Family, friends, exercise and relaxation were a secondary
concern. Some people in the program had more balanced approaches to work. They
may not have made as much progress at the start of the lab, but by the end of
the lab, they had more energy and more motivation remaining.  After ‘Demo Day’,
the people who had maintained a balanced work rhythm were more capable of
leaping into the next stage of their business. My advice for people entering an
accelerator is: prepare for a marathon, not a sprint. The end of the program is
still just the beginning of your business. Don’t exhaust yourself on the first
leg of the journey. </p>

<h2>Some people will be lucky to come out with a business; everyone has the
choice to come out with great friends and good networks</h2>

<p>It is too easy to have a laser focus on building your
business and neglect to socialise and connect with peers. For the shy or introverted,
it is also too easy to just hang out with your own team. Prioritise having fun
with your accelerator comrades. It will help you keep that work-life balance,
it will make your experience more memorable and meaningful and you will gain
friends and future work colleagues. In a few months your relationships and
networks may be more valuable to you than your business ever was. </p>

<h2>Was it worth it?</h2>

<p>I thoroughly enjoyed my experience in the Lightning Lab
accelerator. Our team came into Lightning Lab on the back of two years of
part-time work on our business and it progressed in the lab at a far greater
rate than it had anytime during the previous two years. We experienced many ups
and downs; I managed to balance my initial habit of over working; I learnt a
year’s worth of experience in three months and I gained some great friends. So,
if I encounter anyone considering applying to enter the Lightning Lab or a
similar accelerator, I will wholeheartedly encourage them to do so. </p>
